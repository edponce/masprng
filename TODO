change datatypes to int64_t standard conventions
fix not long64
memory manager, output interface return primitive types instead of SIMD
use typedef for aligned types, so aligned attribute is in one place
for now in LCG, init_rng datatypes do not necessarily match internal work variables (and maybe others). Will have to wait until developing other RNGs.


simd/sse.h: *  NOTE: currently only support x86_64, GCC and Intel compilers
simd/sse.h: *  NOTE: type conversion performed with scalar FPU since SSE does not support 64-bit integer conversions.

lcg/lcg_config.h:// NOTE: required here for SIMD_ALIGN definition
lcg/lcg_config.h:// NOTE: requires C++11 for non-static initialization in declaration of struct/class
lcg/lcg_simd.cpp:// NOTE: eventually would like only the single int version remains, since SPRNG interface uses int
lcg/lcg_simd.cpp:    gentype = CONFIG.GENTYPE; // NOTE: refactor this, use std::string or char[] with strncpy
lcg/lcg_simd.cpp:    // NOTE: prime check/set is incomplete
lcg/lcg_simd.cpp:// NOTE: should return contiguous ints?
lcg/lcg_simd.cpp:    // NOTE: casting done with CPU, bad!!
lcg/lcg.cpp:    // NOTE: verify these checks
lcg/lcg_simd.h:    // NOTE: thread-safe?
