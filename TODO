put objects files in obj/
for now in LCG, init_rng datatypes do not necessarily match internal work variables (and maybe others). Will have to wait until developing other RNGs.

add 'extern "C"' to allow library linked from C/C++/MATLAB/other languages
memory manager, output interface return primitive types instead of SIMD
provide 2 modes for layout of random numbers: (1) interleaved streams, (2) independent streams with additional function to change between streams

simd/simd.h:#include <stdint.h> // NOTE: remove this
simd/sse4_1.h: *  NOTE: add type suffix to all functions to make interface C valid?
lcg/vlcg.h:    // NOTE: thread-safe?
lcg/vlcg.cpp: *  NOTE: The gn parameter is the same for all streams since the generators are run
lcg/vlcg.cpp: *  NOTE: int and float streams use all parameters from input arrays,
