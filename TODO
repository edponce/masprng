for now in LCG, init_rng datatypes do not necessarily match internal work variables (and maybe others). Will have to wait until developing other RNGs.

memory manager, output interface return primitive types instead of SIMD
provide 2 modes for layout of random numbers: (1) interleaved streams, (2) independent streams with additional function to change between streams
fix builtin features support

lcg/vlcg.h:    // NOTE: thread-safe?


In Intel 17 compilers:
    1. -Wno-unused-result flag not available
    2. detectIntelProcSIMD() undefined _FEATURE_XX
    3. detectProcSIMD() returns 0
    4. warning #854: const variable "GLOBALS" requires an initializer -- class "LCG_GLOBALS" has no user-provided default constructor
