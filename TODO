put objects files in obj/
change datatypes to int64_t standard conventions
use typedef for aligned types, so aligned attribute is in one place
for now in LCG, init_rng datatypes do not necessarily match internal work variables (and maybe others). Will have to wait until developing other RNGs.

memory manager, output interface return primitive types instead of SIMD
provide 2 modes for layout of random numbers: (1) interleaved streams, (2) independent streams with additional function to change between streams


lcg/vlcg.h:    // NOTE: thread-safe?
lcg/lcg.cpp:    // NOTE: verify these checks
lcg/vlcg.cpp:// NOTE: eventually would like only the single int version remains, since SPRNG interface uses int
lcg/vlcg.cpp:    // NOTE: prime check/set is incomplete
lcg/vlcg.cpp:// NOTE: should return contiguous ints?
lcg/vlcg.cpp:    // NOTE: casting done with CPU, bad!!
