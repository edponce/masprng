select stream config
port to POWER9 SO arch
put objects files in obj/
change datatypes to int64_t standard conventions

fix not long64
instead of single NUM_STREAMS, use NUM_STREAMS_INT, NUM_STREAMS_FLT, NUM_STREAMS_DBL
memory manager, output interface return primitive types instead of SIMD


use typedef for aligned types, so aligned attribute is in one place
use only LONG64 version

simd/sse.h:// NOTE: this functionality should be handled by a driver routine
utils/utils.cpp:// NOTE: change to not require pointer parameter
lcg/lcg_config.h:// NOTE: required here for SIMD_ALIGN definition
lcg/lcg_config.h:// NOTE: requires C++11 for non-static initialization in declaration of struct/class
lcg/lcg_simd.cpp:// NOTE: eventually only the single int version remains, since SPRNG interface uses int
