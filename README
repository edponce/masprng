MASPRNG - Intel MIC (vector) accelerated SPRNG library

General requirements:
    GNU compilers, require 4.8 or greater for __builtin_cpu_supports()
    C++ - function overloading, object-oriented 
    C++11 - non-static initialization in struct/class

SIMD requirements:
    SSE - at least SSE4.1 for _mm_mullo_epi32() and _mm_test_all_zeros()
    AVX - at AVX2

Only a single SIMD technology is allowed per SPRNG object.
All SIMD macro decisions are ordered from most recent technology backwards.
This allows the use of best available technology without the user having to specify.
Note that the user is allowed to decide on a specific technology using a macro definition.
