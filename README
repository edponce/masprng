MASPRNG - Intel MIC (vector) accelerated SPRNG library

For GNU compilers, require 4.8 or greater
C++11 - variadic macros, OOP

SIMD requirements:
SSE - at least SSE4.1 for simd_mullo_epi32() and simd_test_zero()
AVX - need AVX2

Only a single SIMD technology is allowed per SPRNG object.
All SIMD macro decisions are ordered from most recent technology backwards.
This allows the use of best available technology without the user having to specify.
Note that the user is allowed to decide on a specific technology using a macro define.
