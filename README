MASPRNG - Intel MIC (vector) accelerated SPRNG library

C++ - function overloading
C++11 - variadic macros

SIMD requirements:
SSE - need SSE4.1
AVX - need AVX2

Only a single SIMD technology is allowed per program.
All SIMD macro decisions are ordered from most recent technology backwards.
This allows the use of best available technology without the user having to specify.
Note that the user is allowed to decide on a specific technology using a macro define.
