MASPRNG - Intel MIC (vector) accelerated SPRNG library

General requirements:
    GNU compilers, require 4.8 or greater for __builtin_cpu_supports()
    C++ - function overloading, object-oriented 
    C++11 - non-static initialization in struct/class

SIMD requirements:
    SSE - at least SSE4.1 for _mm_mullo_epi32()
    AVX - at AVX2

Only a single SIMD technology is allowed per SPRNG object.
All SIMD macro decisions are ordered from most recent technology backwards.
This allows the use of best available technology without the user having to specify.
Note that the user is allowed to decide on a specific technology using a macro definition.

Each VSPRNG object generates random numbers from multiple streams. The number of streams
depends on the width of the vector unit and the SPRNG mode (LONG or not). The LONG_SPRNG
mode is faster, but allows less streams per vector register, so there is a tradeoff.

The scalar SPRNG objects are supported via the same interface as SPRNG v5.0. The vector SPRNG
objects are supported via a very similar interface as SPRNG v5.0.

As part of this project, a C interface for Intel SIMD intrinsics was developed. This interface
allows applications to easily and systematically access the available vector technologies.
